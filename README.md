# 📱-friendly CO COVID-19 Wastewater Data ✨

_All the same official data, without all the ArcGIS!_

---

# What is this?
The official COVID wastewater data from CDPHE, presented in a mobile-friendly format (fast and responsive).

# Why is this?
The state health department maintains a very cool, interactive, map-based 
[website to monitor COVID wastewater](https://cdphe.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/d79cf93c3938470ca4bcc4823328946b) 
sampling trends. However that site is nearly impossible to use on a mobile device, which is usually what I have 
handy when I'm trying to catch up on trends.

# I can haz more details?

This is a lightweight [Streamlit](streamlit.io/) app to display data from the API I created to 
supply this information in a queryable fashion. You can see that project 
[over here](https://github.com/jrmontag/co-covid-ww).
