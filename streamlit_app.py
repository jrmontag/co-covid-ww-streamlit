# What is this?
The official COVID wastewater data from CDPHE, presented in a more mobile-friendly format (fast and responsive).

# Why is this?
The state health department maintains a very cool, interactive, map-based 
[website to monitor COVID wastewater](https://cdphe.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/d79cf93c3938470ca4bcc4823328946b) 
sampling trends. However that site is nearly impossible to use on a mobile device, which is usually what I have 
handy when I'm trying to catch up on trends.
