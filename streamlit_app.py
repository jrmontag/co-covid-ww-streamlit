# What is this?
The official COVID wastewater data from CDPHE, presented in a mobile-friendly format (fast and responsive).

# Why is this?
The state health department maintains a very cool, interactive, map-based 
[website to monitor COVID wastewater](https://cdphe.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/d79cf93c3938470ca4bcc4823328946b) 
sampling trends. However that site is nearly impossible to use on a mobile device, which is usually what I have 
handy when I'm trying to catch up on trends.

Here are some Denver metro regions with less obvious utility names:
- most of Denver, Lakewood, Englewood: `Metro WW - Platte/Central`
- Arvada, Wheat Ridge, Westminster: `Metro WW - Clear Creek`
- Centennial, Littleton, Ken Caryl: `South Platte`

For maps of all utilities, check out 
[the CDPHE page](https://cdphe.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/d79cf93c3938470ca4bcc4823328946b) (from a computer).
